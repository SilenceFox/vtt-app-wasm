# Purpose

These are scripts, code, or any other kind of tool that i decided to arquive.

> Why not just delete them?

- Because they may be useful, and potentially useful to others, but are not useful to me.

> Should everything go here?

- Absolutely not. This is just better if simply commenting stuff out is not enough.
- Think of this as something like a "gitignore". But potentially useful for other things, mainly reference to how things were done.
