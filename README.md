# Overview

Trying out new tech, not open to PRs! Also learning Rust, so not a fan of the HTML/JS side. **It is what it is**.

## Smol Roadmap

- [ ] A Working UI!
- [ ] Adding Functionality
- [ ] Never again touching JS.
- [ ] Include a proper CSS.

# Development

Run the following command in the root of the project to start the Dioxus dev server:

dx serve --hot-reload --open

> Consider adding --port=8080 (or another) if you're not using a random port.

- Open the browser to http://localhost:8080

Translate your HTML files with `dx translate`.

> Im using Grass as my SASS compiler.

Please NeoVim devs fix my identation on html!() and rsx!() macros, its painful.
